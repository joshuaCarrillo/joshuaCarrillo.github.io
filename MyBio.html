<h3>About Me</h3>
<body style ="background-color: burlywood"></body>
<body>
I grew up in Aurora, Illinois and have lived here my entire life. I have two old sisters who have both graduated from AU.
I first started coming to Aurora University in 2017 originally studying Criminal Justice. However, there were a lot of unclairites so i decided to join the Marine Corps Reserves.
This is where i found my interest in computers and technology. I am still a reservist with the MOS title of Air Defense Systems Technicial. I am married, have a 3-year-old son named Mateo and 4-month old daughter named Camila.
I go to Aurora University.
